# {frontmatter.title}

This site uses [Vite][vite] and [Remark][remark] plugins that let you write MDX routes in your Remix app.
These MDX routes are transformed to JS at build-time.

Server-side utilities query the frontmatter of each MDX file so that pages can display lists of posts.

The best part is that Remix has your back as your app gets more complex.
Need to grab data your database?
It's just Remix, so use a `loader`.
Remix let's you use the _same_ mental model and the _same_ tools all the way from a simple blog to a complex app.
No rearchitecting is required.

## Plugins

MDX support in Vite is provided by [`@mdx-js/rollup`][mdx-js-rollup].
[Frontmatter][frontmatter] support in Remark is provided by [`remark-frontmatter`][remark-frontmatter] and [`remark-mdx-frontmatter`][remark-mdx-frontmatter].

Check out [`vite.config.ts`][vite-config] to see how these are wired together.

## MDX routes

To take advantage of [nested routes][nested-routes], posts are under `/blog/`
so that the `blog.tsx` parent route can handle layout and styling uniformly for all posts.

The about page is a one-off route so it handles its own styling.
There are probably other ways to handle styling without needing a surrounding `<div />`, but that seemed the simplest for now.
It is still a nested route relative to the root route, so it gets the site layout for free.

## Querying MDX routes

The home page (`/`) and blog archive (`/blog`) each want to display a subset of the posts.
Specifically, they want to display metadata about each included post.

The naive solution would be to read the files directly, say with `fs.readFileSync` and then parse the frontmatter.
There are a couple issues with this approach.
For one, the MDX routes are _routes_ not content and they will be built to a different location.
Also, if you were using any other plugins for MDX or frontmatter, you'd have to duplicate that setup to parse the posts.

Luckily, Vite's [glob imports][import-meta-glob] makes this easy.
But relying on Vite, it handles transforming the MDX routes with the same transformation pipeline that is setup in `vite.config.ts`.

Importantly, all frontmatter queries run behind a `loader` so that only the data needed by each page is sent over the network.
Otherwise, chunks for _all_ posts would get sent to the browser even if a route like the home page only wanted to display metadata for a subset of the posts.

## Alternatives

This approach handles MDX at build-time.
For some use-cases, you might prefer to handle MDX at runtime.
It's a bit more work since you have to setup a [Unified][unified] pipeline yourself,
but it let's you model posts as _content_ rather than routes.
That is, you would have a `blog.$slug.tsx` route that would dynamically load the MDX content for that post.

There are different trade-offs here, so its up to you to decide which one is better.
But the approach this site takes is often a simpler starting point.
